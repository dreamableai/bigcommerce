Wordpress plugin that shows dropdowns for State and City Select for woocomerce

== Description ==

This WooCommerce plugin transforms the text input for states, the city or town. With this plugin you can provide a list of states and cities to be shown as a select dropdown.

= Supported Countries =
 * Nigeria

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

WordPress 4.0  or greater
Woocommerce 2.2 or greater
PHP version 5.2.4 or greater
MySQL version 5.0 or greater

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you donâ€™t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WooCommerce, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click `Add New`.

Search for `Woocommerce States, Cities, and Places`, install and activate

= Manual installation =

[See wordpress codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation)

= Updating =


Automatic updates should work like a charm; as is the best practice, back up should be undertaken before updates.

If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with the shop/category pages after an update you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting 'save'. That should return things to normal.
